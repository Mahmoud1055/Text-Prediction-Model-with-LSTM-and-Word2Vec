# Text Prediction Model with LSTM and Word2Vec

This script builds a text prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sequence based on a given input sentence. It leverages the PersonaHub dataset for training and allows users to interactively predict the next word in a sentence.

## Installation
